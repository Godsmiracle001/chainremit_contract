# KYC Validation Fix for Loan Requests

## Issue Description

**Issue #40**: Missing KYC Validation in Loan Requests

The `requestLoan()` function had commented-out KYC validation, allowing users with invalid KYC status to request loans. This could violate compliance requirements and create regulatory risks.

## Root Cause

The KYC validation line was commented out in the `requestLoan()` function:
```cairo
// assert(self.is_kyc_valid(requester), KYCErrors::INVALID_KYC_STATUS);
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `requestLoan()` Function

**Location**: `src/starkremit/StarkRemit.cairo` (lines 1817-1860)

**Changes Made**:
- Uncommented and properly implemented KYC validation
- Made KYC validation conditional based on `kyc_enforcement_enabled` flag
- Added proper user registration validation

**Updated Function**:
```cairo
fn requestLoan(ref self: ContractState, requester: ContractAddress, amount: u256) -> u256 {
    let caller = get_caller_address();

    // Validate caller is not zero address
    assert(!caller.is_zero(), RegistrationErrors::ZERO_ADDRESS);
    
    // Validate user registration
    assert(self.is_user_registered(requester), RegistrationErrors::USER_NOT_FOUND);
    
    // Conditional KYC validation based on enforcement setting
    if self.kyc_enforcement_enabled.read() {
        assert(self.is_kyc_valid(requester), KYCErrors::INVALID_KYC_STATUS);
    }
    
    assert(amount > 0, 'loan amount is zero');
    
    // Ensure the user has no active loans
    assert(!self.active_loan.read(requester), 'User already has an active loan');
    
    // Ensure the user has not requested a loan already
    assert(!self.loan_request.read(requester), 'has pending loan request');

    // ... rest of loan creation logic
}
```

### 2. KYC Validation Logic

The `is_kyc_valid()` function checks:
- KYC status is `Approved`
- KYC has not expired (expires_at > current_time)
- Returns `false` for any other status (Pending, Rejected, Suspended, etc.)

```cairo
fn is_kyc_valid(self: @ContractState, user: ContractAddress) -> bool {
    let kyc_data = self.user_kyc_data.read(user);
    let current_time = get_block_timestamp();

    match kyc_data.status {
        KycStatus::Approved => {
            if kyc_data.expires_at > current_time {
                true
            } else {
                false
            }
        },
        _ => false,
    }
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage

Added 6 new test cases in `tests/test_loan.cairo`:

#### Test Cases Added:

1. **`test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_disabled`**
   - Verifies users without KYC can request loans when enforcement is disabled
   - Ensures backward compatibility

2. **`test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_enabled_no_kyc`**
   - Verifies users without KYC cannot request loans when enforcement is enabled
   - Tests proper error message: `KYC: invalid status`

3. **`test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_enabled_valid_kyc`**
   - Verifies users with valid KYC can request loans when enforcement is enabled
   - Tests successful loan request flow

4. **`test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_enabled_expired_kyc`**
   - Verifies users with expired KYC cannot request loans
   - Tests expiration validation

5. **`test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_enabled_suspended_kyc`**
   - Verifies users with suspended KYC cannot request loans
   - Tests suspension validation

6. **`test_kyc_enforcement_toggle_affects_loan_requests`**
   - Tests that toggling KYC enforcement affects loan request behavior
   - Verifies dynamic enforcement changes

7. **`test_loan_request_kyc_validation_integration`**
   - Integration test for complete KYC validation flow
   - Tests with Enhanced KYC level

## Compliance Benefits

### 1. Regulatory Compliance
- Ensures loan requests comply with KYC/AML requirements
- Prevents unauthorized access to loan features
- Maintains audit trail for compliance reporting

### 2. Risk Mitigation
- Reduces regulatory risk exposure
- Prevents non-compliant loan issuance
- Maintains platform integrity

### 3. Flexible Enforcement
- Allows administrators to enable/disable KYC enforcement
- Supports different compliance requirements across jurisdictions
- Provides operational flexibility

## Usage Examples

### Enabling KYC Enforcement (Admin Only)
```cairo
// Only admin can enable KYC enforcement
contract.set_kyc_enforcement(true);
```

### Setting User KYC Status (Admin Only)
```cairo
// Set valid KYC for user
contract.update_kyc_status(
    user_address,
    KycStatus::Approved,
    KycLevel::Basic,
    verification_hash,
    expires_at_timestamp
);
```

### Requesting Loan with KYC Validation
```cairo
// This will automatically check KYC if enforcement is enabled
let loan_id = contract.requestLoan(user_address, amount);
```

## Error Messages

The following error messages are returned for KYC validation failures:

- `KYC: invalid status` - When KYC validation fails
- `User not found` - When user is not registered
- `User already has an active loan` - When user has existing loan
- `has pending loan request` - When user has pending request

## Testing Instructions

### Run All Loan Tests
```bash
snforge test --test test_loan
```

### Run Specific KYC Tests
```bash
# Test KYC enforcement disabled
snforge test --test test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_disabled

# Test KYC enforcement enabled with valid KYC
snforge test --test test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_enabled_valid_kyc

# Test KYC enforcement enabled without KYC (should panic)
snforge test --test test_loan_request_with_kyc_enforcement_enabled_no_kyc
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Deploy contract with KYC enforcement enabled**
2. **Register a user without KYC**
3. **Attempt to request loan** → Should fail with `KYC: invalid status`
4. **Set valid KYC for user**
5. **Request loan again** → Should succeed
6. **Disable KYC enforcement**
7. **Request loan without KYC** → Should succeed

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control
- Only admins can enable/disable KYC enforcement
- Only admins can update user KYC status
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized changes

### 2. Validation Chain
- User registration validation
- KYC status validation (when enabled)
- Loan eligibility validation
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. Audit Trail
- All KYC status changes are logged as events
- Loan requests are tracked with timestamps
- Compliance reporting capabilities

## Future Enhancements

### 1. KYC Level Requirements
- Different loan amounts may require different KYC levels
- Enhanced validation based on loan size

### 2. Automated KYC Expiry
- Automatic loan suspension when KYC expires
- Notification system for expiring KYC

### 3. Multi-Jurisdiction Support
- Different KYC requirements per region
- Jurisdiction-specific validation rules

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that the StarkRemit contract properly validates KYC status for loan requests, maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements while providing flexibility for different operational scenarios. The comprehensive test coverage ensures the fix works correctly across all scenarios and edge cases.
